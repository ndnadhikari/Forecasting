# Modeling Monthly Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index to Forecast the Future Value

This study aims to fit different forecasting models for the monthly Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA or DJI) index, and make two years ahead forecasts by using the best-fitted model. As crude oil is an important commodity traded in the financial markets globally, time series linear regression is also used by considering the price of crude oil as a predictor variable. Through careful examination of each model fitted on the time series, state space model was found to yield better fit for the DJI series. The maximum likelihood criterion (AIC & BIC), mean absolute scaled error (MASE), BG test and diagnostic checks are used for evaluating the accuracy of each model. In addition, the dataset was divided into training and test sets to cross-validate each model. We use time series plots as a cross-validation procedure to evaluating the model accuracy. Although the prediction of the stock market is a challenging task, the forecast of the state space model did capture the trend of the index. The forecast shows there is potential for the index to continue its uptrend in the next two years. However, financial markets are influenced by numerous indicators, and our study is purely quantitative and focuses only on historical prices.
